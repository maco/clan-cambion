Long, long ago, the [Society for Creative Anachronism](https://sca.org/) had not yet reached Maryland. It was a West Coast phenomenon. Yet, there were medievalists getting together and playing anyway in the [Markland Medieval Mercenary Militia](https://www.markland.org/). When the SCA finally reached Maryland, there was conflict. Was there enough room for both groups?

Clan Cambion began when some Marklanders decided to try out the SCA. They brought their skills in arts and music, dispelling the myth that Marklanders were uncultured. They found a home in the SCA.

Over 40 years later, those first Cambions have raised a generation of children (now adults) in the SCA. We continue to believe in playing nicely with other medieval groups. Some of us play with [Dagorhir](https://dagorhir.com/) as well.
