Much has been written on SCA households before. In short, we're a group of friends who share the SCA as a hobby and like to do things together.

Some households are exclusive, allowing membership in only one household; we are not. Clan Cambion is a "household of households."

Some households are formed around a specific activity, such as fighting; we are not. We have a strong artsy streak, yes, but we have Knights and Pelicans in our ranks as well.

In the case of Clan Cambion, many of us are quite literally family. We were born into the SCA and raised on its [values](/values/), and now we are raising our children here too.
