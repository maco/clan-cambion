Our largest gathering of the year is at the [Pennsic War](https://pennsicwar.org/) in the summer. We have a centrally-located [encampment](/pennsic/).

The second-largest gathering is our Mathom Party each winter. The name comes from Tolkien. A mathom is a trinket that's too good to throw away but you don't really need. It's a good candidate for regifting, and that's what we do. The Mathom Party is a regifting party.

Throughout the year, we hold other ad-hoc get-togethers. Singing is a popular activity. Madrigals and shapenote are popular styles with us. (Yes, shapenote is post-SCA-period, but it's fun!)

We also love to cook and feed people; our unofficial motto is "jeet jet?" ("Did you eat yet?")
